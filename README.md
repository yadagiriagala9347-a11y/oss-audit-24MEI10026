## Open Source Software Audit — Capstone Project
**Course:** Open Source Software  
**Student:** Yadagiri Agala  
**Registration Number:** 24MEI10026 
**Chosen Software:** Apache HTTP Server (Apache License 2.0)

## Project Overview

This repository contains all shell scripts and supporting materials for the **Open Source Audit** capstone project. The audit examines **Apache HTTP Server**, its origin, philosophy, licensing, Linux footprint, ecosystem, and comparison with proprietary alternatives.

## Scripts Description

### Script 1 - System Identity Report
**File:** `script1.sh`

Displays a formatted audit panel with system information: Linux distro name, kernel version, logged-in user, home directory, uptime, current date/time, and a note identifying the GPL license under which Linux is distributed, alongside the chosen software — Apache HTTP Server.

**Concepts used:** Variables, `echo`, command substitution `$()`, `grep` with `cut` and `tr` for distro detection, basic output formatting.

---

### Script 2 - FOSS Package Inspector
**File:** `script2.sh`

Checks whether the `apache2` package is installed on the system using `dpkg`, prints its version and package summary, and displays a philosophy note about the package using a `case` statement. Supports notes for other common FOSS packages as well.

**Concepts used:** `if-then-else`, `case` statement, `dpkg -l`, pipes with `grep`, hardcoded package variable.

---

### Script 3 - Disk and Permission Auditor
**File:** `script3.sh`

Loops through a predefined list of important system directories and reports the disk space used by each, along with the owner, group, and permission string. Also performs a dedicated check on the Apache configuration directory `/etc/apache2`.

**Concepts used:** `for` loop over arrays, `du -sh`, `ls -ld`, `awk` to extract fields, conditional directory existence checks.

---

### Script 4 - Log File Analyzer
**File:** `script4.sh`

Reads a log file line by line, counts how many lines contain a specified keyword (default: `error`), and prints a summary report with the last 5 matching lines. Includes retry logic if the file is found to be empty on the first check.

**Concepts used:** `while read` loop, `if-then`, counter variables `$(())`, command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`), `grep`, `tail`, `sleep`-based retry logic.

---

### Script 5 - Open Source Manifesto Generator
**File:** `script5.sh`

Interactively asks the user three questions about their open-source values and composes a personalised open-source philosophy statement using their answers along with the current date and system username. The manifesto is saved to a `.txt` file named after the current user.

**Concepts used:** `read -p` for user input, string interpolation into output, file writing with `>`, `date` command, `whoami`, alias concept demonstration.

## How to Run Each Script on Linux

### Prerequisites
- A Linux system (Kali Linux or Ubuntu recommended)
- Bash shell (version 4.0 or higher — check with `bash --version`)
- Apache HTTP Server installed (`sudo apt install apache2 -y`)

### Step 1 - Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xylarian/oss-audit-24MEI10026 .git
cd oss-audit-24MEI10026 
```

### Step 2 - Install Apache HTTP Server
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

### Step 3 - Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x script1.sh
chmod +x script2.sh
chmod +x script3.sh
chmod +x script4.sh
chmod +x script5.sh
```

### Step 4 - Run each script

**Script 1 - System Identity Report**
```bash
./script1.sh
```
No arguments needed. Displays system information and audit details automatically.

---

**Script 2 - FOSS Package Inspector**
```bash
./script2.sh
```
No arguments needed. Inspects the `apache2` package by default and prints its details and philosophy note.

---

**Script 3 - Disk and Permission Auditor**
```bash
# Run as normal user
./script3.sh

# Run with sudo for complete directory size reporting
sudo ./script3.sh
```
No arguments needed. Audits standard system directories and the Apache config path automatically.

---

**Script 4 - Log File Analyzer**
```bash
# Basic usage - search for 'error' in syslog (default keyword)
./script4.sh /var/log/syslog

# Search for a specific keyword
./script4.sh /var/log/syslog warning
./script4.sh /var/log/auth.log failed

# On Kali Linux
./script4.sh /var/log/kern.log error
```

---

**Script 5 - Open Source Manifesto Generator**
```bash
./script5.sh
```
Interactive - will prompt you for three answers. The manifesto is saved to `manifesto_<username>.txt` in the current working directory.

| `whoami` | Current user                   | Yes                      |
| `uptime` | System uptime                  | Yes                      |
| `date`   | Date/time                      | Yes                      |
| `du`     | Disk usage                     | Yes                      |
| `ls`     | File/directory info            | Yes                      |
| `awk`    | Text processing                | Yes                      |
| `grep`   | Pattern matching               | Yes                      |
| `tail`   | Last N lines of output         | Yes                      |
| `dpkg`   | Package info (Debian systems)  | On Debian/Ubuntu/Kali    |
| `sleep`  | Retry delay                    | Yes                      |
